<h1>
	<p>Build Team</p>
	</h1>
	

<h1 style="float:left;">The build team is responsible for the mechanical design and fabrication of the robot and other projects that go on
throughout the year. The subteam also is responsible for the electronics and control systems for the robot and provides important 
information to the programming subteam.</h1><img src="Build_Subteam.jpg" height=75 width=225 style="float:right;"/>

<h1>
	<p>Programming Team</p>
	</h1>

<h1 style="float:left;">Wando Advanced Robotics programming team is responsible for many tasks within the team. Some are responsible for 
the basic coding of the yearly robot, allowing the robot to function and eligable to compete at competitions. The programming team itself 
contains many subteams within itself as well. The robot programming subteam is responsible for the ability for the robot to function. 
Members of the Pit UI programming subteam are responsible for the programming of the pit program, allowing the robot to connect to the
driver station. Members of the programming team are also part of the website subteam, who create and maintain the team website.</h1>

<h1>
	<p>CAD Team</p>
	</h1>

<h1 style="float:left;">The Computer-Aided Design(CAD) team are a group of students who help with the basic building blocks for almost 
anything developed by the build team. The CAD team is responsible for 3d modeling ideas. They brainstorm and create basic digital 3d 
models of the brainstormed ideas and help others decide what will be the best for build and how to approach the start of a building 
project.</h1><img src="CAD_Subteam.jpg" height=75 width=225 style="float:right;"/>

<h1>
	<p>Imagery Team</p>
	</h1>

<h1 style="float:left;">Robotics is not just all about robots. Being a FIRST team requires every team to project their creativity and their messages to others. The imagery team does 
exactly that. The imagery team is responsible for the yearly design of the team's T-shirts, as well as designing the team's theme and logo onto the bot and work pit. Members of the imagery
subteam also maintain social media connections such as Twitter and Instagram to help spread the message of FIRST.</h1><img src="Imagery_Subteam.jpg" height=75 width=225 style="float:right;"/>
	<!--I'm not sure if we are going to go through with the social media, remove social media part if not included-->

	<p>Scout Team</p>
	</h1>
	
<h1 style="float:left;">The scouting subteam is active during the competitions Team 4533 partakes in and is are essentials for the longterm success of the team during competitions. The
scouting subteam is responsible for analyzing the performance of other bots during competitions. This way, the team as a whole can decide which bots at the competitions are the best
match for our team's robot to ensure maximum success during alliance selections with other teams. Without the scout team, strong alliances with other teams cannot be created, lowering the
team's chances of reaching far in the FIRST competitions.</h1><img src="Scout_Team.jpg" height=75 width=225 style="float:right;"/>
